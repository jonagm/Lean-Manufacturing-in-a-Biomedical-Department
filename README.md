# Lean Manufacturing in a Biomedical Department
Project that helped improve bottlenecks in equipment review activities, task assignment, and organization for social service and professional internship members using Lean Manufacturing tools and PowerBI

## FOCUS
This project focused on four key principles:
1.	**Waste Elimination (Muda Method)**: Focused on eliminating activities that do not add value to the process.
2.	**Continuous Improvement (Kaizen Method)**: Aimed at seeking constant improvements in processes.
3.	**Leveled Production (Heijunka Method)**: Seeks to level the workload consistently to avoid bottlenecks.
4.	**Lean Management System**: Implementation of an efficient system that encourages employee participation in problem-solving and continuous process improvement.

## PROBLEM
The biomedical department faces inefficiencies in its organization, structure, and workflow, leading to idle time and undefined roles, particularly for interns and social service staff.
The main focus areas to address these inefficiencies are:
1.	**Waiting**: Define specific roles to ensure a minimum number of daily reviews of equipment within the department.
2.	**Organization**: Establish a _minimum quality standard_ regarding the number of devices reviewed per day/week and improve the organizational structure to standardize the staff's activities and knowledge.

## SOLUTION STATEMENT
Medical equipment and hospital areas that can be inspected more easily will be identified to meet quality standards in equipment review. _The aim is to balance the daily workload without compromising patient care_. Additionally, _data will be collected on the times and types of activities performed by interns and social service staff to identify waste and areas for improvement_.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SOLUTION
To tackle inefficiency in the biomedical department, the "Lean Manufacturing" system was implemented, based on three key pillars:
1.	**Division of Activities**: A format was created to divide equipment review activities by zones, _covering 10% of the total hospital equipment (minimum required quality)_. Each week, department members will rotate roles, applying the Heijunka method to balance the workload.
2.	**Identification of Waste and Time**: A second format was designed to record all activities performed by department members. It includes information on whether the task was completed, the reasons if not, familiarity with the equipment, the time taken, and the waste category. This helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
3.	**Continuous Improvement Meetings**: Weekly meetings are held to evaluate the performance of each team member using _PowerBI analysis_. These meetings foster collaboration and support among department members, making adjustments that benefit both the staff and the department head.

## DASHBOARD FINDINGS (INSIGHTS)
•	**Identification of Problematic Equipment**: The analysis helped identify specific devices that cause the most issues during inspections and those that fail the most frequently.

•	**Detection of Knowledge Gaps**: Deficiencies in staff knowledge of certain medical equipment were identified, highlighting the need for targeted training programs.
